    <p>Book Name: Bollywood Burglary</p>
    <p>Author: Geronimo Stilton</p>
    <p>Genre: Fiction</p>
    <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
    <h3>Review:</h3>
    <p>I am an Indian and when I saw the cover of the book with an Indian lady who is a mouse wearing a saree I started laughing my lungs out, in this book Geronimo helped Hercule poirat to protect the ring, I think the thief was very dumb to trade the expensive ruby for a banana.... my favourite character was Hercule poirat as he begged Geronimo to come to India.my favourite part of this book was the trading done by a monkey as it was very funny...ha ha.ha.i also quite enjoyed the play. it was just a typical Bollywood type play or movie. it was a very fun-filled book with a shot of craziness.</p>

     <p>Book Name: Fright Night</p>
     <p>Author: Geronimo Stilton</p>
     <p>Genre: Fiction</p>
     <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
     <h3>Review:</h3>
     <p>It was a very interesting book. This book was all about poetry. It reminded me of my sister as she also writes poems sometimes. This book was funny as Boris was kidnapped. It also had a mystery surrounding the competition where Boris was. This mystery was solved by my two favourite characters in this book that is Creepella von cacklefur and GERONIMO STILTON. I rated it five stars as It was very funny and mysterious. they were lots of clues and it helped me to also figure out what was going on. My favourite poem of all was Phantom's tale by Boris Von Cacklefurand also the rap by the creepy crew. This book inspired me to write poems too which didn't turn quite well. the person who kidnapped Boris as quite a surprise I actually kinda expected it but the secret behind the kidnapper really shocked me.</p>

     <p>Book Name: Thea Stilton and The Mystery On The Orient Express </p>
     <p>Author: Geronimo Stilton</p>
     <p>Genre: Fiction</p>
     <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
     <h3>Review:</h3>
     <p>It has beautiful illustrations and she loves the mystery. I liked the inclusion of historical elements like the orient express and the roaring 20s. The Thea Sisters themselves are not very well developed characters and I rarely knew which was which when they were talking and interacting. The secondary characters were more interesting. However, I recommend it because it is visually engaging and it keeps the kiddos guessing about the mystery. Plus, it left me wanting to learn more about the Orient Express which is always the mark of a good book - leaves you wanting to read more, learn more.</p>

     <h3>Review:</h3>
     <p>This was another cute installment in the Geronimo Stilton series. I loved the addition of the Egyptian mythology. I can see why kids love this series. I will most likely do a series review once I've read a few more.</p>

     <p>Book Name: My Name Is Stilton, Geronimo Stilton </p>
     <p>Author: Geronimo Stilton</p>
     <p>Genre: Fiction</p>
     <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
     <h3>Review:</h3>
     <p>Um. It's an interesting concept for a book. It's very colorful inside and different words at times have different font which makes it kind of fun.

        Except in this book Geronimo, this mouse who a publisher, hires another mouse, whom he doesn't like at first. She is not an honest mouse and got an interview with this famous performer...but told him lies to get it. And Geronimo knows that she has told him lies but still keeps her as his assistant because he's afraid the other competitors will get her and her book that she was told by performer that she could write for him.
        
        The rest of the story is meh...okay....but I just thought that there should have been some moral of how she shouldn't have lied. Especially since she's a big character in this one book at least.</p>

        <p>Book Name: Thea Stilton And The Mystery In Paris</p>
        <p>Author: Geronimo Stilton</p>
        <p>Genre: Fiction</p>
        <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
        <h3>Review:</h3>
        <p>This was quite a fabumouse story! The Thea Sisters, five teen-aged mice from all over the world that are best friends, are all going to Collete's home city, Paris, for vacation. While there, Collete's cousin, Julie, is preparing for her fashion show. However, someone steals her entire collection! It is up to the Thea Sisters to find the culprit and help Julie. While the actual plot is very predictable, the format of the book is very welcoming to beginning chapter book readers. There are bright pictures, bigger font, and different colors and styles of font that pepper the text and make it rather jazzy. Younger readers that might be scared of reading boring black and white text chapter books will welcome the bright words. Another cool feature is that there are informational sidebars about some of the aspects of French culture, which will help the young readers learn about French culture while they enjoy this cheerful mystery. The only fault to me is that at times all of the features, like the colors and sidebars, can be distracting. Overall, this book is highly recommended for readers ages 7-11.</p>

        <p>Book Name: The Quest for Paradise: The Return to the Kingdom of Fantasy </p>
        <p>Author: Geronimo Stilton</p>
        <p>Genre: Fiction</p>
        <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
        <h3>Review:</h3>
        <p>This was the book I've read wid the most pages but its Geronimo so not much words either. Wat i like abt these Geronimo books r they r so creative and have brilliant idea to show and describe a noun. The names given also describes it well. In this book i had fun lookin to the crystal key everytime it's not that easy too but still it was fun. Sth that annoying was the riddles and the page where they showed the letter of another fantasy kingdom's language, i kept forgetting the page. They were many different kingdoms which I can't take my eyes off. Each one looks as imaginative as it sounds. The details and names given for each place i get to find a new word in every name. I truly enjoyed reading this book.</p>

        <h3>Review:</h3>
        <p>I thought the book was really good. It was good because the four friends tried to help the other friend which just led them to another mystery. It was just cool because it had an unexpected twist.</p>
