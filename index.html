<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>Our website is a sophisticated Books review non-eCommerce site catering to Books review which may help u know about the famous Geronimo Stilton books.</p>
    The Original Geronimo Stilton Series:

   <p>
    Geronimo Stilton, our newspaper mouse protagonist, embarks on exciting adventures, solving mysteries and saving New Mouse City. The books are fast-paced, filled with colorful illustrations and maps.
    The series emphasizes the importance of knowledge and reading, with brainpower triumphing over brawn.
    However, there are some family-relationship issues, and occasionally unique spellings can be confusing for young readers.
    Overall, these books are exciting and perfect for ages 7 to 101.
    Graphic Novels:
    
    The series also has graphic adaptations. In one original tale, Geronimo learns that the Pirate Cats are in 1492, aiming to take over Columbus’s expedition and seize the New World’s riches.
    The panels are small but vibrant, and the characters have a Disneyesque appeal.
    While historical accuracy takes a back seat to action and slapstick, these graphic novels are sure to be as popular as the original series2.</p>
